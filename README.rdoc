== Library Reloading Weirdness

This application renders whatever ReloadLib::test returns at its root. It does
this by creating a constant from ReloadLib in
config/initializers/create_constant.rb, which then has test called on it in the
application controller.

If you change ReloadLib::test, then the reloaded class won't be applied to the stored value from the initializer.
